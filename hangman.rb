# When a new game is started, your script should load in the dictionary and randomly 
# select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word.

# display some sort of count so the player knows how many more incorrect guesses 
# he/she has before the game ends. You should also display which correct letters 
# have already been chosen (and their position in the word, e.g. _ r o g r a _ _ i n g) 
# and which incorrect letters have already been chosen.
# Every turn, allow the player to make a guess of a letter. 

# It should be case insensitive. Update the display to reflect whether the letter was 
# correct or incorrect. If out of guesses, the player should lose.
# Now implement the functionality where, at the start of any turn, 
# instead of making a guess the player should also have the option 
# to save the game. Remember what you learned about serializing objectsâ€¦ 
# you can serialize your game class too!

# When the program first loads, add in an option that allows you to open one of your saved games,
#  which should jump you exactly back to where you were when you saved. Play on!
